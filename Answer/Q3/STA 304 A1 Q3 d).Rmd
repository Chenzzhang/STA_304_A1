## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
student_number <- (c(1,0,0,4,7,8,4,6,4,6))
N = choose(10, 3)
tibble(
'Mean' = mean(combn(student_number, 3, mean)),
'Variance' = round(((var(combn(student_number, 3, mean)) * (N-1))/N), digits = 2))
```
```
