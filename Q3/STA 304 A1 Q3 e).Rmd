## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
student_number <- (c(1,0,0,4,7,8,4,6,4,6))
set.seed(1004784646)
hbar = rep(0,250000)
for(i in 1:250000){hbar[i]=mean(sample(student_number, 3, replace = TRUE))}
hist(hbar, xlab = 'Sample Mean Based on Drawing samples of Size 3 with Replacement', main = 'Histogram of Sample Mean #4646')
```
